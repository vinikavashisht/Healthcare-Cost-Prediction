# Healthcare-Cost-Prediction
Introduction
Health insurance is a type of insurance product that specifically guarantees the health costs or care of the insurance members if they fall ill or have an accident. With time and ever-increasing healthcare costs, health insurance has become a necessity in today’s world. The rising cost of health care is one of the most pertinent problems in US. Accordingly, predicting such costs with accuracy is a significant first step in addressing this problem. But why is health insurance so expensive?
To find an answer to this question, we are conducting an analysis of a health insurance data in the US.

Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the impact of several factors on insurance costs and predict the cost of health insurance based on factors that influence. We perform multiple linear regression to achieve this objective. This analysis is to determine the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, whether each independent variable is positively or negatively related and to predict the value of the dependent variable if the value of the independent variables increases or decreases.

Data Description
The data contains 1338 observations consisting of several variables, including age, sex, children, smoker, region, and charges.
•	Age: insurance contractor age in ‘years’ (continuous) 
•	Sex: insurance contractor gender (factor) 
•	BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 (continuous)
•	Children: number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents (continuous) 
•	Smoker: smoking, Yes/No (factor) 
•	Region: the beneficiary’s residential area in the US, [northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest] (factor) 
•	Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance, response value (continuous)
